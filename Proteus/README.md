In this experiment, we will design, construct, and test four combinational logic circuits.
The first two ("design example" & "majority logic") circuits are to be constructed with NAND gates, the third ("parity generator") with XOR gates,
and the fourth ("decoder implementation") with a decoder and NAND gates.
