# State Diagram

Design, construct, and test a sequential circuit whose state diagram is shown [here](./state_diagram.png).

Designate the two flip-flops as A and B, the input as x, and the output as y .

Connect the output of the least significant flip-flop B to the input x, and predict the sequence of states and output that will occur with the application of clock pulses.

Verify the state transition and output by testing the circuit.

See [state table](./state_table.jpg), [maps](./maps.jpg), [logic diagram](./logic_diagram.jpg) and [circuit](./circuit.png) of this section.
