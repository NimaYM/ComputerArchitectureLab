# DECODER IMPLEMENTATION

A combinational circuit has three inputs— x, y, and z —and three outputs— F1, F2, and F3.

The simplified Boolean functions for the circuit are

```bash
F1 = xz + x!y!z!
F2 = x!y + xy!z!
F3 = xy + x!y!z
```

Implement and test the combinational circuit, using a 74155 decoder IC and external NAND gates.
